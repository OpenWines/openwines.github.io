## What is OpenWines?

We started OpenWines in march 2015: OpenWines is not a startup or a commercial initiative: it's an [open-data](http://opendatahandbook.org/en/what-is-open-data/index.html#what-is-open) collaborative project about wines.

'Open' means free, available, reusable, redistribuable, interoperable, and open to contributions. Not only the data are free, but also the tools, softwares, schemas, design, illustration and documentation that come with them. This will remain as is, for ever, without conditions or limitatitions other than specified in the Open Data License (to come).

Work in progress!
